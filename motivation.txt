A project on admission recommendation that helps recommend courses and institutions
to students seeking admission into tertiary institutions(universities, polytechnics 
and colleges of education) in South West Nigeria. This works by referring qualified 
student, probably unqualified for chosen course, admissions into another course in 
same university or same/another course in other universities, depending on their 
interests. The idea is that students who do not meet the cut-off mark of schools 
due to large applications, yet possess strong/considerable academic qualifications 
should be referred to other other courses in the same institution that they qualify 
for (before the end of change of course/university by jamb) or same/other closely 
related course in other universities that they qualify for and can apply to.
